Politics

Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination. How did that happen? I guess this could be good news for the Democrats... or the end of the world as we know it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b4c1067d-479f-42eb-8fbd-4da16e9324a3.jpg)

Education 

When Typhoon Haiyan wiped out nearly 90% of schools in parts of the Philippines, some folks decided to get resourceful.

Health
