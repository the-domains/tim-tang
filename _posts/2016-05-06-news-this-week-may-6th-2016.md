Politics

Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination. How did that happen? I guess this could be good news for the Democrats... or the end of the world as we know it. 

Education 

When Typhoon Haiyan wiped out nearly 90% of schools in parts of the Philippines, some folks decided to get resourceful. Since 2013, the Philippines Foundation have managed to get 100% of local kids back into school by turning fishing boats into impromptu classrooms. 

Health

The World Health Organization is using a new Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) to monitor childbirth services across Indonesia. The software compares healthcare in different regions and with other countries to improve equal access to services for the poorest populations. 

Sport

Leicester City have to go down as the greatest Cinderella sports story of all time. They even won the English Premier League with 3 games to spare! According to the bookmakers, Kim Kardashian becoming US President, Northern Ireland winning the World Cup, and Senegal winning Olympic Gold in Basketball were just some of things deemed more likely than Leicester winning the league this season...incredible.
